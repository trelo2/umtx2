# PS5 UMTX Jailbreak

The exploit code is largely based on the lua implementation by @shahrilnet and @n0llptr: https://github.com/shahrilnet/remote_lua_loader/blob/main/payloads/umtx.lua

The rest of the setup is based on the previous works by @SpecterDev and @ChendoChap: https://github.com/PS5Dev/PS5-UMTX-Jailbreak/

Thank you to them and everyone else who worked on the umtx and psfree exploit!
